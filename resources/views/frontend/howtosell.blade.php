                    <p class="text-center"> Firstly, you must set up an account by clicking on the “login/register” icon
                        located at the top right of the page. Click on “create an account here” at the bottom of the pop-up
                        and ensure that you are registering as a seller. Simply put in all of your details and click “join
                        now”. Very shortly after, you will receive a verification email on the email you have used to
                        register (be sure to check spam mail for the verification email). After this, you can start making
                        your products.
