					any way, you are agreeing to comply with the TOU. In addition, when using particular MamboDubai
					services, you agree to abide by any applicable posted guidelines for all MamboDubai services, which

				<h3> 3. ELIGIBILITY FOR USE
				</h3>
				<p> MamboDubai reserves some parts of the Service exclusively for professional
					purchasers, sellers, collectors and resellers of items and accessories who are acceptable to
					MamboDubai in its sole discretion. Although MamboDubai attempts to limit the use of these parts of
					the Service to such purchasers, sellers, collectors and resellers of items and accessories, nothing
					herein shall create any right of action against MamboDubai for failing to adequately screen
					potential users or prevent the use of MamboDubai or the Service by users who are not professional
					purchasers, sellers, collectors and resellers of items or accessories.

				</p>
				<h3>4. CONTENT</h3>
				<p> You understand that all advertisements, postings, messages, text, files, images,
					photos, video, sounds, or other materials (“Content”) posted on, transmitted through, or linked from
					the Service are the sole responsibility of the person from whom such Content originated. More
					specifically, you are entirely responsible for each individual item of Content that you post, email
					or otherwise make available via the Service. Likewise, if you request the assistance of MamboDubai
					to post content, or if you imply consent that MamboDubai may post content on your behalf, either by
					written or oral means, or you fail to inform MamboDubai that content should be removed, you are
					equally responsible for the content. You waive any and all claims against MamboDubai of a right of
					publicity for your image or likeness throughout the world by posting any information or pictures of
					yourself on MamboDubai. You understand that MamboDubai does not control, and is not responsible for
					personal Content made available through the Service, and that by using the Service, you may be
					exposed to Content that is offensive, indecent, inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise objectionable.
					When you post User Content to the Service, you authorize and direct us to make such copies thereof
					as we deem necessary in order to facilitate the posting and storage of the Content on the Service.
					By posting Content to any part of the Service, you automatically grant, and you represent and
					warrant that you have the right to grant, to the Company an irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive,
					transferable, fully paid, worldwide license (with the right to sublicense) to use, copy, publicly
					perform, publicly display, reformat, translate, excerpt (in whole or in part) and distribute such
					Content for any purpose on or in connection with the Service or the promotion thereof, to prepare
					derivative works of, or incorporate into other works, such Content, and to grant and authorize
					sublicenses of the foregoing. Furthermore, MamboDubai and Content available through the Service may
					contain links to other websites, which are completely independent of MamboDubai. MamboDubai makes no
					representation or warranty as to the accuracy, completeness or authenticity of the information
					contained in any such site. Following links to any other websites is at your own risk. You agree
					that you must evaluate, and bear all risks associated with, the use of any Content, that you may not
					rely on said Content, and that under no circumstances will MamboDubai be liable in any way for any
					Content or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any Content posted,
					emailed or otherwise made available via the Service. You acknowledge that MamboDubai does not
					pre-screen or approve Content, but that MamboDubai shall have the right (but not the obligation) in
					its sole discretion to refuse, delete or move any Content that is available via the Service, for
					violating the letter or spirit of the TOU or for any other reason.
				</p>

				<h3>5. THIRD PARTY CONTENT, SITES, AND SERVICES

				<p> MamboDubai and Content available through the Service may contain features and
					functionalities that may link you or provide you with access to third party content which is
					completely independent of MamboDubai, including web sites, directories, servers, networks, systems,
					information and databases, applications, software, programs, products or services, and the Internet
					as a whole. Your interactions with organizations and/or individuals found on or through the Service,
					including payment and delivery of goods or services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or
					representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and such organizations and/or

					proceeding with any online or offline transaction with any of these third parties. We do not
					guarantee the quality, safety or legality of, any Content, the truth or accuracy of the descriptions
					of any goods or services offered for sale, the right of the sellers to sell or license any such
					goods or services, or the ability of any buyer to purchase any such goods or services. The Service
					is designed for experienced buyers accustomed to buying goods and services based on photographs
					and/or descriptive text. Buyers should assume that any goods offered are not new, unless otherwise
					stated, nor in perfect condition, and may require touch-up or repairs prior to use and that the
					available information about the items may be limited. It is not possible for MamboDubai to verify
					information provided by the seller of any item.
					You agree that MamboDubai shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort
					incurred as the result of any dealings between users of the Service. If there is a dispute between

				<h3>9. POSTING AGENTS </h3>

				<p> A “Posting Agent” is a third-party agent, service, or intermediary that offers
					to post Content to the Service on behalf of others. To moderate demands on MamboDubai’s resources,
					you may not use a Posting Agent to post Content to the Service without express permission or license
					from MamboDubai. Correspondingly, Posting Agents are not permitted to post Content on behalf of
					others, to cause Content to be so posted, or otherwise access the Service to facilitate posting
					Content on behalf of others, except with express permission or license from MamboDubai.
				</p>
				<h3>10. NO SPAM POLICY </h3>

				<p>You understand and agree that sending unsolicited email advertisements to
					MamboDubai email addresses or through MamboDubai computer systems is expressly prohibited by these
					TOU. Any unauthorized use of MamboDubai computer systems is a violation of the TOU and certain
					federal and state laws, including without limitation the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (18 U.S.C. §
					1030 et seq.). Such violations may subject the sender and his or her agents to civil and criminal
					penalties.
				</p>
				<h3>11. PAID POSTINGS </h3>

				<p>We may charge a fee to post Content in some areas of the Service. The fee is an
					access fee permitting Content to be posted in a designated area. Each party posting Content to the
					Service is responsible for said Content and compliance with the TOU. All fees paid will be
					non-refundable in the event that Content is removed from the Service for violating the TOU. Fees
					collected for specific services, such as subscription services and advertising, are non-refundable
					unless otherwise stated in writing for a specific promotional program.
				</p>
				<h3>12. LIMITATIONS ON SERVICE </h3>

					Service, including the maximum number of days that Content will be retained by the Service, the
					maximum number and size of postings, email messages, or other Content that may be transmitted or
					stored by the Service, and the frequency with which you may access the Service. You agree that

					maintained or transmitted by the Service. You acknowledge that MamboDubai reserves the right at any
					time to modify or discontinue the Service (or any part thereof) with or without notice, and that
					MamboDubai shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension or

				<p>MamboDubai grants you a limited, revocable, nonexclusive license to access the
					Service for your own personal use. This license does not include: (a) access to the Service by
					Posting Agents; or (b) any collection, aggregation, copying, duplication, display or derivative use
					of the Service nor any use of data mining, robots, spiders, or similar data gathering and extraction
					tools for any purpose unless expressly permitted by MamboDubai. A limited exception to (b) is
					provided to general purpose internet search engines and non-commercial public archives that use such
					tools to gather information for the sole purpose of displaying hyperlinks to the Service, provided
					they each do so from a stable IP address or range of IP addresses using an easily identifiable agent
					and comply with our robots.txt file. “General purpose internet search engine” does not include a
					website or search engine or other service that specializes in classified listings or in any subset
					of classifieds listings such as decorative goods or furniture, or which is in the business of
					providing classified ad listing services.
					MamboDubai does not permit you to display on your website, or create a hyperlink on your website to,
					individual postings on the Service, absent express permission granted by MamboDubai to do so. You
					may create a hyperlink to the home page of MamboDubai, so long as the link does not portray
					MamboDubai, its employees, or its affiliates in a false, misleading, derogatory, or otherwise
					offensive matter.
					MamboDubai may offer various parts of the Service in RSS format so that users can embed individual
					feeds into a personal website or blog, or view postings through third party software news
					aggregators. MamboDubai permits you to display, excerpt from, and link to the RSS feeds on your
					personal website or personal web blog, provided that (a) your use of the RSS feed is for personal,
					non-commercial purposes only, (b) each title is correctly linked back to the original post on the
					Service and redirects the user to the post when the user clicks on it, (c) you provide, adjacent to
					the RSS feed, proper attribution to “MamboDubai” as the source, (d) your use or display does not
					suggest that MamboDubai promotes or endorses any third party causes, ideas, web sites, products or
					services, (e) you do not redistribute the RSS feed, and (f) your use does not overburden
					MamboDubai’s systems. MamboDubai reserves all rights in the content of the RSS feeds and may
					terminate any RSS feed at any time.
					Use of the Service beyond the scope of authorized access granted to you by MamboDubai immediately
					terminates said permission or license. In order to collect, aggregate, copy, duplicate, display or
					make derivative use of the Service or any Content made available via the Service for other purposes
					(including commercial purposes) not stated herein, you must first obtain a written license from
					MamboDubai that has been signed by one of MamboDubai’s authorized representatives.

				</p>
				<h3>14. TERMINATION OF SERVICE</h3>
				<p>You agree that MamboDubai, in its sole discretion, has the right (but not the obligation) to delete
					or deactivate your account, block your email or IP address, or otherwise terminate your access to or
					use of the Service (or any part thereof), immediately and without notice, and remove and discard any
					Content within the Service, for any reason, including, without limitation, if MamboDubai believes
					that you have acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of the TOU. Further, you agree that
					MamboDubai shall not be liable to you or any third-party for any termination of your access to the
					Service. Further, you agree not to attempt to use the Service after said termination. Sections 2-7
					and 13-20 shall survive termination of the TOU.</p>

					treaties. Content displayed on or through the Service is protected by copyright as a collective work
					and/or compilation, pursuant to copyrights laws, and international conventions. Any reproduction,

					license to use, copy, perform, display, and distribute said Content and to prepare derivative works
					of, or incorporate into other works, said Content, and to grant and authorize sublicenses (through
					multiple tiers) of the foregoing. Furthermore, by posting Content to any public area of the Service,

				<h3> 17. LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY</h3>

				<h3>19. GENERAL INFORMATION </h3>
				<p> The TOU, and any additional terms to which you agree when using particular elements of the Service,
					constitutes the entire agreement between you and MamboDubai and governs your use of the Service,
					superseding any prior agreement between you and MamboDubai. The failure of MamboDubai to exercise or
					enforce any right or provision of the TOU shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
					If any provision of the TOU is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties
					nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as
					reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the TOU remain in full force and effect. You
					agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising
					out of or related to use of the Service or the TOU must be filed within one (1) year after such

				<h3> 20. VIOLATION OF TERMS AND LIQUIDATED DAMAGES</h3>
				<p> Please report any violations of the TOU by sending an email to notice@mambodubai.com.
					Our failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive our right to act with
					respect to subsequent or similar breaches.
					You understand and agree that, because damages are often difficult to quantify, if it becomes
					necessary for MamboDubai to pursue legal action to enforce the TOU, you will be liable to pay
					MamboDubai the following amounts as liquidated damages, which you accept as reasonable estimates of
					MamboDubai’s damages for the specified breaches of the TOU:
					If you post a message that (i) impersonates any person or entity; (ii) falsely states or otherwise
					misrepresents your affiliation with a person or entity; or (iii) that includes personal or
					identifying information about another person without that person’s explicit consent, you agree to
					pay MamboDubai one thousand dollars ($1,000) for each such message. This provision does not apply to
					messages that are lawful non-deceptive parodies of public figures.
					If MamboDubai establishes limits on the frequency with which you may access the Service, or
					terminates your access to or use of the Service, you agree to pay MamboDubai one hundred dollars
					($100) for each message posted in excess of such limits or for each day on which you access
					MamboDubai in excess of such limits, whichever is higher.
					If you send unsolicited email advertisements to MamboDubai email addresses or through MamboDubai
					computer systems, you agree to pay MamboDubai twenty five dollars ($25) for each such email.
					If you post Content in violation of the TOU, other than as described above, you agree to pay
					MamboDubai one hundred dollars ($100) for each item of Content posted. In its sole discretion,
					MamboDubai may elect to issue a warning before assessing damages.
					If you are a Posting Agent that uses the Service in violation of the TOU, in addition to any
					liquidated damages under clause (d), you agree to pay MamboDubai one hundred dollars ($100) for each
					and every item of Content posted in violation of the TOU. A Posting Agent will also be deemed an
					agent of the party engaging the Posting Agent to access the Service (the “Principal”), and the
					Principal (by engaging the Posting Agent in violation of the TOU) agrees to pay MamboDubai an
					additional one hundred dollars ($100) for each item of Content posted by the Posting Agent on behalf
					of the principal in violation of the TOU.
					If you aggregate, display, copy, duplicate, reproduce, or otherwise exploit for any purpose any
					Content (except for your own Content) in violation of the TOU without MamboDubai’s express written
					permission, you agree to pay MamboDubai three thousand dollars ($3,000) for each day on which you
					engage in such conduct.
					Notwithstanding any other provision of the TOU, MamboDubai retains the right to seek the remedy of
					specific performance of any term contained in the TOU, or a preliminary or permanent injunction
					against the breach of any such term or in aid of the exercise of any power granted in the TOU, or to
					seek to recover damages arising from or relating to a violation of this TOU or any combination
